# Testing:
- Clone the repo
- run npm install in AutomatonExplorer
- run npm start
- go to http://localhost:3000

# Issues & ToDo
- Make a useful README
- Dragging doesn't work on mobile devices.
- Some cells are not toggled when mouse movements are too fast.
- Pointer events are triggered when opening the context menu, which is undesirable.
- The default settings on the landing page are not ideal for the Elementary Cellular Automaton demo.
- The help menu and landing page could be nicer to look at, offer more features, etc.
- Add an option to hide the help menu permanently.
- Add more keyboard shortcuts (in particular, add shortcuts for quicker toggling of cells with more than two states). e.g. in wireworld, hold c and click for conductors, h for electron heads, t for electron tails.
